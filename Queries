1. List all students enrolled in a particular course:

SELECT S.StudentID, S.FirstName, S.LastName, C.CourseName
FROM Students S
JOIN Enrollments E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID
JOIN Courses C ON E.CourseID = C.CourseID
WHERE C.CourseName = 'Computer Science';

2. List all courses a particular student is enrolled in:

SELECT S.FirstName, S.LastName, C.CourseName
FROM Students S
JOIN Enrollments E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID
JOIN Courses C ON E.CourseID = C.CourseID
WHERE S.StudentID = 1;

3. Generate a student's transcript:

SELECT S.FirstName, S.LastName, C.CourseName, E.EnrollmentDate
FROM Students S
JOIN Enrollments E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID
JOIN Courses C ON E.CourseID = C.CourseID
WHERE S.StudentID = 1
ORDER BY E.EnrollmentDate;

4. Find the number of students enrolled in each course:

SELECT C.CourseName, COUNT(E.StudentID) AS NumberOfStudents
FROM Courses C
LEFT JOIN Enrollments E ON C.CourseID = E.CourseID
GROUP BY C.CourseName;

5. List all students and their corresponding courses:

SELECT S.FirstName, S.LastName, C.CourseName
FROM Students S
JOIN Enrollments E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID
JOIN Courses C ON E.CourseID = C.CourseID
ORDER BY S.LastName, S.FirstName;
